# Example of MVVM with Repository Pattern Using Compose for UI and Navigation accessing multiple API's

I have used two seperate free API's to show the capabilities of MVVM using Compose Navigation.

All code and configuration created completely by Mark Talent - mtalent@live.com

Package MyApp contains Compose Navigation Functions


# Login Screen uses Firebase Auth for user authorization must register before logging in

# Page one will display a random quote from the quote api on the push of a button

# Page two displays a vertically scrolling list of quotes that will display the selected quote from the list

# Page three displays a random joke from a second joke api on the push of a button

# Page four has a multiple choice trivia game from a third trivia API

<sub>Started the application last month as a four-page game, then decided to just make it a coding example for possible employers (hence the sweetp package).</sub>
